class_name HitboxComponent
extends Area2D
## An Area2D that *deals* damage. Put it on a player's AttackHitbox or an
## enemy's AttackArea. It stays passive (it never reads overlaps itself);
## instead a HurtboxComponent detects it and pulls these values.
##
## `hit_once_per_attack` makes a single swing hit each target only once, even
## if the hitbox overlaps it for several frames.
